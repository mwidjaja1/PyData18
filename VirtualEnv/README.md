# Python Environment Management

This class teaches the basics of managing a Python environment using
`virtualenv`.

Python virtualenvs are a way of isolating the software a given project
needs from the system it's running on, and from other projects you're
working on.

These environments are easy to create and recreate, and that ease
frees you from worrying about forgetting what a project needed in
order to work right, and from worrying about messing something up. If
you know how they work, you can always destroy one and recreate it
fresh and clean.

This class is divided into seven short lessons. We'll go through them
in order, and they do depend on each other, but only lightly.

The class is completely self-contained, anything important I will say
out loud is written down in the text, so you should be able to go
through the class again on your own, or share it with others later.
