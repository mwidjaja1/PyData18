Welcome To Dask Examples
========================

This is a live session from which you can run example notebooks showing how to use Dask.

A file browser listing example notebooks is available to the left.
There are two notebooks there that you should open:

1.  Dataframes: for scalable Pandas dataframes
2.  Delayed: for parallelizing general code

Dask dashboard plots are available to the right.  These will activate when you
run the cells in your Jupyter notebooks that create a Dask cluster and client (these cells are already written for you).

To get started, double click on the `dataframes.ipynb` file on the left, and start running through the Jupyter notebook cells.  You will eventually get to exercise cells that will require you to do some work.
